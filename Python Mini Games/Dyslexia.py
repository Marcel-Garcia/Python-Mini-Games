# Example Python code that will take a word input from the user and translate each letter with the 3rd letter above it on the alphabet:

word = input("Enter a word to be translated: ")
new_word = ""

for letter in word:
    # Check if the letter is a lowercase letter
    if letter.islower():
        # Convert the letter to its ASCII code and add 3 to it
        new_letter = chr((ord(letter) - 97 + 3) % 26 + 97)
        new_word += new_letter
    # Check if the letter is an uppercase letter
    elif letter.isupper():
        # Convert the letter to its ASCII code and add 3 to it
        new_letter = chr((ord(letter) - 65 + 3) % 26 + 65)
        new_word += new_letter
    # If the letter is not a letter, keep it the same
    else:
        new_word += letter

print("Translated word:", new_word)

# This code uses a for loop to iterate over each letter in the input word. 
# For each letter, it checks whether it is a lowercase or uppercase letter using the islower() and isupper() methods, respectively. 
# If the letter is a letter, it converts it to its ASCII code using the ord() function, adds 3 to the code to shift it up 3 letters in the alphabet, 
# takes the modulo 26 to wrap around if necessary, and converts the result back to a letter using the chr() function. 
# If the letter is not a letter, it is kept the same. 
# The translated word is then built up character by character in the new_word variable and printed out at the end.
